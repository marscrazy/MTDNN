# MTDNN
This is implementation of Multi-scale Two-way Deep Neural Network [paper](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/0628.pdf)

# Benchmark dataset CSI-2016
> CSI-2016 is our collected dataset from three one-minute
stock index data, including the Shanghai Stock Exchange
(SSE) Composite Index SH000001, Shenzhen Stock Exchange Small & Medium Enterprises (SME Boards) Price
Index SZ399005 and ChiNext Price Index SZ399006. It
has over 170, 000 samples spanning a year from January
1st, 2016, to December 30th, 2016. Each sample is a one minute data of
6 dimensions which are high, low, open, close, volume and
amount, respectively.R
